# Design a Basketball Game App

## Instructions

The design process is an essential part of app development. During this process, you're able to get your ideas out into the open and identify potential challenges early on prior to development. Whether completed individually or in a group, going through the steps of the design process enables you to consider different approaches to designing an app.

For this activity, you'll go through the design process for a basketball game app that you'll create later in this curriculum. The app itself will be a prototype for the game which could later be transitioned into either an AR or VR app.

Complete each step of the design process below for the basketball game app.

### App Overview

The basketball game app consists of a single player that shoots a basketball into a hoop. To take a shot, the player must first hold the ball into a hold position, lift the ball overhead, and then shoot the ball into the hoop. After the player takes a shot, the player is given the ball to take another shot. The player scores 1 point for each successful shot.

### Bodystorming
Grab or create a few real-world objects to represent objects in the basketball game. We encourage you to get creative and rely on the supplies available to you. As you select your objects, write down its purpose in relation to the basketball game.

### Acting

Using the objects from the prior exercise, act out game play for the basketball app. Consider the different interactions and decisions the player may take and apply that to your acting.

### Storyboarding

Create a storyboard that illustrates the app game play. You can create a storyboard using either pen/pencil and paper or a digital platform of your choice. The storyboard should illustrate the steps a player takes from start to finish.
